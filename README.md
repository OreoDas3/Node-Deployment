# Node-Deployment
Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are composed of a finite set of sensor devices geographically distributed in a given indoor or outdoor environment (usually predefined).
A WSN aims to gather environmental data and the node devices placement may be known or unknown a priori. Network nodes can have actual or logical communication with 
all devices; such a communication defines a topology according to the application. For instance, there can be a WSN with both types of topologies being the same (mesh, 
star, etc.). However, this may not be the case for all applications. The logical topology is mainly defined based on the nodes logical role (tasks, etc.). It can be 
either ad hoc or strategy based (self-organization, clustering, pheromone tracking, and so on). The strategy is defined based on the network available resources.
